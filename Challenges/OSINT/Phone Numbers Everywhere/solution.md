# Phones Everywhere

# Intended Solution
Users should use the inspector via an image app to access the longitude and latitude tagged onto the image. From there, you can put that into google maps which will direct you to a building. That building is SCDI (the Sobrato Campus for Discovery and Innovation), and you obtain the phone number of that building which is the flag. 

# Make sure to remove all non-alphanumeric characters before submitting the flag
# Find what building the longitude and latitude are pointing to, and the phone number to that building
