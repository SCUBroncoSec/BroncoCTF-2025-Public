# Elite Stacker

## Description

YOOOO check out this new personal best in sprint that my bestie yoshie just got! He truly is the elitest elite stacker of all time! (p.s. not really. he needs *waaaay* more T-Spins.)

Ok honestly though, that mode is boooooring. Where's all the garbage at? No challenge at all.

Tell me, what is the highest floor and altitude in the Zenith Tower that yoshie has climbed up to?

**Flag Format:** `bronco{<Floor Name> <Altitude>}`, where:

- `Floor Name` is the name (NOT number) of the floor. Include space(s).

- `Altitude` is a decimal number, commas optional, with `m` at the end for meters.

- There is a space between the entries.
