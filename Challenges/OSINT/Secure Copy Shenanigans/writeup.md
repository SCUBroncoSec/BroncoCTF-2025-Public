# Info
Title: Secure Copy Shenanigans
Flag: bronco{shootwrongscp}
# Challenge
A list of numbers corresponding to articles on the SCP wiki are given. Looking through these numbers and finding the titles of the corresponding SCPs gives the flag.

Also has OSINT elements since my discord description talks about SCPs.
# Solution
Secure Copy is abrieviated SCP, the friend's confusion also hints that it's not about Linux.

Once finding SCP, the numbers are a dead giveaway to the articles.

There are only so many things to check in the article, especially since they know some of the letters.

Eventually they will find the titles.

From there it's trivial.
