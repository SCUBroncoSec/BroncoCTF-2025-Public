# Secure Copy Shenanigans

## Description

My friend keeps talking about how much they *love* secure copy. It's just a Linux command? How can anyone care that much?

When I said this, they gave me a weird look and said `4025 7286 8203 3124 1469 2436 6688 7654 682 4508 6316 096 491 1939 079 2750 5168 3322 5336 3891 }`.

What does that even mean?
