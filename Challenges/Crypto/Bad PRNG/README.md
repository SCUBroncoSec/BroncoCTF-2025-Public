# Mid PRNG

## Description

It's an age old dilemma: do you take the time to set up slow, perfectly random numbers or use potentially predictable pseudorandom ones?
Until now! I've developed a fast, *unbreakable* random number system.

I'm so confident in the security of this system that I've decided to use it to broadcast the flag for all to see.
Not that anyone will ever really know what it is...
