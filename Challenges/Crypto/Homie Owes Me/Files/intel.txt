Psst... Luigi here. I have some intel on this mysterious yoshie user. He:

1. Really likes being called a homie. Specifically, yoshiethehomie.
2. Likes to talk in "partial leetspeak."
3. Is a fan of "one, only one!" special character replacement.
4. Appends his 4-digit PIN to all his secure logins.
5. Loves BroncoCTF so much that he includes the flag format in his credentials.

This info wasn't easy to get! But, he owes me money too, so you better catch this fool and gimme some of the dough I also deserve!
