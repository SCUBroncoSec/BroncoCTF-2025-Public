# Info
Title: Straight Up Circular
Flag: bronco{tr4n5p0sit1on_my_bel0v3d}
# Challenge
This challenge gives only the flag, and leaves the rest to the user. This should be a fairly easy challenge, since there is not much to do or work with.
It was made using [this script](./setup.py)
# Solution
Looking at the flag should reveal that all of the letters to make the known part of the flag are in the middle of the string.
Further examination should reveal that you can link them all together by going back and forth.
Then, a simple python script such as [this](./solution.py) can be written.
Or, you can put the characters on paper and draw an expanding circle, which will reveal the code.
