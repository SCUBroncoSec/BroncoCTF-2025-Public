# Challenge
This was made with a bunch of copies of the smiling dog, and changing the date on them.

See chall.py for the actual code.

# Solution
Notice the dates are the only things about the files that at any different from each other.

From there, if you plot it out there's clearly some pattern. Solving this pattern gives another, until you are finally done.

Then, write something like solution.py, and it'll give you the flag.
