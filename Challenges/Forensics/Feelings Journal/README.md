# Feelings Journal

## Description

My brother's New Year's resolution in 2012 was to keep a "feelings journal" of his mood. 
I told him I found it, but he said there wasn't anything sensitive in there, so I could look through it if I wanted to.

From a passing glance, it looks like he's feeling really good.

Something looks off about it though... can you tell me what he is really saying?
