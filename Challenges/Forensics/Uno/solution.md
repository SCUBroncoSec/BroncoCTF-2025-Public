## Intended Solution:
This image has data hidden inside of it that can be extracted using a program like StegOnline. The cards in the image indicate which bits should be selected (Blue 2, Red 3, Green 5, 4 for all colors), and the "at least" in the description indictes that the bit order should be LSB.
