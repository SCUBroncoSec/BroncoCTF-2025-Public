## Description

So, my friend just hit me up with this lit file, right? But like, they totally forgot to define their keywords—straight up left me hanging. It’s like I’m playing a game of "guess the meaning" with no map. I gotta reverse the code and figure out what’s actually poppin’ in there. There’s a flag hidden somewhere, but it’s got mad twists and turns. If you’re down to decode it too, try flipping the meaning of the words and see if you can catch the vibe. Let's see who can crack it first!
