# Desmos Destroyer

## Description

I just made the best game ever! It's too hard for you to beat though.
Here it is: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pfsf4sl1id
There's some more instructions there. Also, there might be some glitches...

The flag is the letter orders you gave in the `bronco{}` format. Example: Orders=\[a,cd,e\] -> `bronco{a,cd,e}`.

Note: Do not edit any equations except for the `Orders` list when testing your answer.
Pasting your orders into a freshly reloaded page should work every time.
Reach out in the Discord immediately if you have correct orders that the site is not accepting.
