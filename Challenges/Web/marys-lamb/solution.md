## Solution

This challenge is really simple. It uses the concept of Phreaking (hinted at by the challenge name) and really wants you to just play Mary Had a Little Lamb on the phone. 

But it requires you to type it in really fast, so you have to look at the network traffic and use the API request. 

To get the numbers, we searched  "mary had a little lamb as a dial tone".  The first results (reddit and ahajokes) have the solution: 32123332223993212333322321

Entering that, you get the flag.
