# Flag Saber

## Description

I decided to make a map of one of my favorite songs in one of my favorite games.

With the amount of fun I had working on this, I took it as a signal to share it with the world!

Note: The flag for this challenge is not in the normal format. Instead, it is the word `bronco ` with some characters following it. 
Submit the full character sequence (including the `bronco `) as the flag.

You do not need any paid software or specialized hardware to solve this challenge.
