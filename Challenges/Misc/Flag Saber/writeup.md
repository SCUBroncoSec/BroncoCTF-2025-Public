# Challenge
Pretty basic, found a classical song about the sea, then used an online Beat Saber map editor to make a map for it.

Look at a semaphore chart and that's about it.

Full semaphore map: `bronco #KJhit#EJth#DJtk#AJnd#KJff#AJag`, which is 38 signals, or about 1 signal every 5 measures

# Solution
It can be figured out that this is a map for the game Beat Saber.

Looking at/playing through the map shows that it is basically random, and none of the external files have anything of note in them.

From the word signal and the references to flags, we can see that this is some kind of flag code.

The most popular sea flag code is semaphore, and parsing the note motions through a semaphore chart reveals the flag.
