# It's a Bird

## Description

I got gifted a raven. I didn't want the raven, but it is mine now. I am going insane, I swear, it just keeps yapping!

My friend, an ornithophile, swears it is trying to tell me something. That there is a deeper message, hidden within. But I dunno, man. It just keeps squawking.
