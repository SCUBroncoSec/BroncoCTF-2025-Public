# Info
Title: Mined Solving This?

Flag: bronco{m1n3d}

Notes: Make sure the flag is case-insensitive
# Challenge
This was made with Axiom.

I made a sphere using a script brush which creates random blocks which are more likely the farther you are from the center of the sphere, 
then use the paint tool to draw with diamonds from different perspectives.

I tried to make sure that the closest diamond block to the letter is the right one, or has already been visited. Otherwise the challenge would be very guessy.

The hint in the description relates to the fact that this is a challenge about perspective.
# Solution
Open the map in a map viewer. This shows limitless void, except for where it shows a big sphere.

Either open the map in Minecraft or use Mineways to turn it into an obj file and open it in a 3D viewer.

Find the different in the middle. It is the only one for some distance, so it is fairly noticeable.
Note that from here you can see a B, which you know is the first letter of the flag.
This is what the description means by "perspective"

Then, go to the block you can see when looking at the B.

Even if you do not go in order, it is pretty apparent to re-assemble, as the majority of the flag is the flag format and the word related to Minecraft/the challenge title.

Continue this until you get to the end.
